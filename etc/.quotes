Hey listen, if something happens to you, and you can't see yourself being upset about it after a year, it's just not worth getting upset about at all.

Security is mostly a superstition. It does not exist in nature, nor do the children of men as a whole experience it. Avoiding danger is no safer in the long run than outright exposure. Life is either a daring adventure or nothing. — Helen Keller
It is a wise man who can learn to accept anything, but only a fool will tolerate it.

Man is nothing more than his works; he only exists to the measure of his self-realization (to the extent wherein he realizes himself). He is nothing other than the ensemble of his actions, nothing other than his life. Jean-Paul Sartre
“However unhappy a person may be, the moment he knows the purpose of his life a switch is turned and the light is on... If he has to strive after that purpose all his life, he does not mind so long as he knows what the purpose is. “Ten such people have much greater power than a thousand people working from morning till evening not knowing the purpose of their life.” –H.I. Khan

"I was dead millions of years before I was born, and it never inconvenienced me a bit."-Mark Twain
There is always a point at which the terrorist ceases to manipulate the media gestalt. A point at which the violence may well escalate, but beyond which the terrorist has become symptomatic of the media gestalt itself. Terrorism as we ordinarily understand it is innately media-related. -William Gibson
"By being a racing driver you are under risk all the time. By being a racing driver means you are racing with other people. And if you no longer go for a gap that exists, you are no longer a racing driver because we are competing, competing to win. And the main motivation to all of us is to compete for victory, it's not to come 3rd, 4th, 5th or 6th. I race to win as long as I feel it's possible. Sometimes you get it wrong? Sure, it's impossible to get it right all the time. But I race designed to win, as long as I feel I'm doing it right." - Arton Senna
Once there was an emperor who wanted to make a temple in his capital holier and more elegant. His servants looked far and wide and found two crews of workmen for the job. One crew consisted of renowned craftsmen and painters, and the other, a band of faithful monks. The emperor could not make up his mind, so he decided to host a contest. The emperor asked each crew to renovate a small temple in the countryside, and whichever side wins his favor wins the bid. After hearing the details of the contest, the craftsmen and painters asked the emperor for paint in thousands of colors, in addition to hundreds of nifty tools. The monks, however, only asked for a handful of clean cloth and water buckets. Three days later, the emperor went to inspect the renovated temples. The craftsmen and painters decorated their temple in the most brilliant colors and with impressive skills. Then, the emperor turned around to see the monks' temple. Rather than adding any color, the monks merely wiped the walls, tables, chairs and windows clean. But everything inside the temple was restored to its original color, and their spotless surfaces became mirrors that reflected the colors outside. The serene and beautiful sight immediately took the emperor's breath away.

Some are meant to live switchfoot.
I remember a Japanese story from my childhood about a seaside farming community in Japan -- many, many years ago -- and an old man who had climbed a hill to watch as the villagers, far below, took part in a harvest festival.  As he stood, contemplating the beautiful scene and the bountiful fields of grain which spread all around him upon the hillside he was suddenly confronted with the sight of a distant, oncoming tsunami as it raced towards the unsuspecting town below.  How to warn the villagers, that was his problem...  There was only one way...Without hesitation the farmer set fire to the crops awaiting harvest..  The villagers saw the flames and rushed up the hill to save their crops...  The crops and the village were lost to the tsunami --- but the villagers were saved.
Arguing that the nation could run out of spectrum is like saying it was going to run out of a color, says David P. Reed, one of the original architects of the Internet and a former professor of computer science and engineering at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. He says electromagnetic spectrum is not finite.
Don’t do anything by half. If you love someone, love them with all your soul. When you go to work, work your ass off. When you hate someone, hate them until it hurts.–Henry Rollins
So, you have a choice. You can keep adopting the flavor-of-the-month language, each one giving you some beautiful new way to iterate over collections, so your method to collate all the user’s previous transactions into a table can be done in 10 lines of code instead of 15. Or maybe you can use so much duck-typing that you get to add the string “4” to the number 2 (and be able to accurately predict whether you’ll get the string “42” or the number 6). Or maybe the next language will do away with all the traditional branch and loop statements (if, for, while, etc.), in favor of some new exotic side-effect-driven style of programming that will be awesome as soon as you and everyone else “get it.” Or, maybe you can drop the pretensions, dismiss the illusions, and tear down the fake world of intents, monads, and whatever crazy new thing they come up with next. What will be left is you, your code, and a CPU waiting to do stuff. - Punk Rock Languages
C has all the power of assembly language combined with all the elegance and poetry of... assembly language.–Erica Sadun
“We are the cosmos made conscious and life is the means by which the universe understands itself.” ― Brian Cox
"There was plenty of error on my part too, of course. I should never have allowed that damned 'test' program to be distributed at all, and should never have added diagnostics to it; running it once in a controlled environment was a risk —- arguably an acceptable one at the time. Multiplying that risk by users and by uses was what made it a catastrophe. I should have stuck my head out of the code and more strenuously objected to the hype." - Daniel Colascione (Haystack resignation)
I must not fear. Fear is the mind-killer. Fear is the little-death that brings total obliteration. I will face my fear. I will permit it to pass over me and through me. And when it has gone past I will turn the inner eye to see its path. Where the fear has gone there will be nothing. Only I will remain. - Bene Gesserit litany against fear
Honor gives little comfort to a man alone in his home, and in his heart. - Martok
